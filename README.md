## HI HELLO!!! (⁠ㆁ⁠ω⁠ㆁ⁠)
usually off-tab, afk even around friends, im a med student and tend to be rlly busy :'3

c+h always encouraged unless with friends (other friends can int whenever), if you initiate a conversation I WILL be really social, but be first pls.

you'll definitely get my attention faster by whispering, if i dont respond im truly sorry!

 current interests are : tf2, madcom, forsaken, block tales, creatures of sonaria, rdr2, brawl stars, ultrakill, pressure 
- mostly games but i love horror movies too! current fav the strangers, mbv, friday 13th and apocalyptic movies<3
- music taste is very flexible i listen to everything (almosttt)

i love my friends and making new ones too, im a social fella and wouldn't mind learning a thing or two about something new!! 

basic dni list, people who are overly rude diagnosed or not i do not tolerate disrespect in any way! know your worth :)
